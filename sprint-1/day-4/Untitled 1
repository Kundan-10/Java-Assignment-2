) What is exception handling in java, Write the hierarchy of Exception class and, Mention some
of the predefined Exception classes at least 5, and the reason when those exception class
object is generated in our application.

                                        **  exception handling **
                                        
                                        
Exception Handling in Java is one of the effective means to handle the runtime errors so that the regular flow of the application 
can be preserved. Java Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, 
IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.

Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program, i.e. at run time, that disrupts
the normal flow of the programâ€™s instructions. Exceptions can be caught and handled by the program. When an exception 
occurs within a method, it creates an object. This object is called the exception object. It contains information about the 
exception, such as the name and description of the exception and the state of the program when the exception occurred.


1. ArithmeticException: If we divide any number by zero, there occurs an
  ArithmeticException.
  
  
  Example : int a=100/0;
  +,-,*./
    
2. NullPointerException: If we have a null value in any reference variable, performing any
  operation on that variable throws a NullPointerException.
  
  
   Example:
   String s=null;
    System.out.println(s.length());//NullPointerException 
    
3. NumberFormatException: If the formatting of any variable or number is mismatched, it
	may result into NumberFormatException. Suppose we have a string variable that has
	characters; converting this variable into digit will cause NumberFormatException.


	Example:
	String s="abc";
	int i=Integer.parseInt(s);//NumberFormatException    
	

4. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: When an array exceeds to it's size, the
	ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs. there may be other reasons to occur
	ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
	
	
	Example:	
	int a[]=new int[5];
     a[10]=50; //ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
                                         **
