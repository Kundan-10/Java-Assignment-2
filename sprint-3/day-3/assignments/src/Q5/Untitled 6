Q5/- What is the difference between the sleep and wait method?


                    **  Wait() **
                    
                    
                    
 1)  Wait() method belongs to Object class.
 2)  Wait() method releases lock during Synchronization.
 3)  Wait() should be called only from Synchronized context.
 4)  Wait() is not a static method. 
 5)  Wait() Has Three Overloaded Methods:
 
		a- wait()
		b- wait(long timeout)
		c- wait(long timeout, int nanos)
  6)   public final void wait(long timeout)
 
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                   **  Sleep() **
                   
 1) Sleep() method belongs to Thread class.
 2)  Sleep() method does not release the lock on object during Synchronization.
 3)  There is no need to call sleep() from Synchronized context.
 4)  Sleep() is a static method. 
 5)  Sleep() Has Two Overloaded Methods:
        a) sleep(long millis)millis: milliseconds
s       b)  leep(long millis,int nanos) nanos: Nanoseconds     
 
  6)  	public static void sleep(long millis) throws Interrupted_Execption
  
  
  
  
  example:-
  
  synchronized(monitor){
	while(condition == true)
	{
		monitor.wait() //releases monitor lock
	}

	Thread.sleep(100); //puts current thread on Sleep
}
