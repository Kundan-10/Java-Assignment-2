Q1/- Explain the meaning of the deadlock in multithreaded application, when it can occur in
multithreading applications.Write one example of deadlock.


ans:-

  Deadlock:
  
 1) A lock without key is know as deadlock.
 2) the Sysnchronized Keyword is reasone for deadlock accors in threads.
 3) if two threads are waiting for each other exection (for some finite time).
  
  4) it is important to use if our program is running in multi -threaded envirnment where two or more threds execute simultaneously .
  but sometimes it also cause a problem which is called Deadlock.
  
  below a examle:-
  
  public class TestDeadlock{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        final String res="kundan";
        final String res2="kunal";
        
        Thread t1=new Thread(){
        public void run(){
        Sysnchronized (res){
        System.out.println("thread 1: locked res 1");
        
        
        try{
        Thread.sleep(100);
        }
        catch(Exception e){}
        Sysnchronized(res2){
        System.out.println("thread 1 locked res 2")}
    }
  }
  }
  }
  
  Thread t2 =new Thread(){
  public void run(){
  synchronized (res 2){
   System.out.println("thread 2 locked res ");
   
   try{
        Thread.sleep(100);
        }
        catch(Exception e){}
        
        
        Sysnchronized(res){
        System.out.println("thread 2 locked res 1")}
  }
  }
  }
  }
  t1.start();
  t2.start();
  }
  }
